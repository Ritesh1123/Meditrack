# ​ MediTrack

A RESTful backend API for managing medicines and pharmacies, built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.  
MediTrack helps in keeping track of medicines, including their stock, pricing, and associated pharmacy information.

---

##  Features

- **CRUD operations** for medicines (fields: name, price, stock, pharmacy reference).  
- **Secure authentication** using JWT-based middleware.  
- **Modular architecture** using controllers, models, routes, and middleware.  
- **Config-driven** environment settings via a `.env` file.  
- **Scalable foundation** for further extensions, including pharmacy or user management.
